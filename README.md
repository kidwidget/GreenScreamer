Guitar Effects Pedal
Uses Kicad
Has extra mounting holes for all capacitors, resistors, and diodes that effect tone. This is so you can solder in female pin headers to test various combinations before commiting. Bottom layer is only for ground plane. It can be omitted if you are making a single sided PCB. This will need jumper wires, refer to picture of finished product.
